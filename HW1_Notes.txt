assigned set 2 and Yahoo

goal: compare search results b/w Google & Yahoo
will use given query set for Yahoo & test for overlap/correlation of results 

note: don't spell check queries (leave as is)

google results --> key = query, values = list of 10 search results, represented by a URL
1st elt in list = top result, last = last result 

overlap = identical result (even if not also 1st result, etc.)
% of identical results = measure of quality of Yahoo
run each query, capture top 10 results (URLs), compute overlap score (ok if < 10 results)

correlation = Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (AKA Spearman's rho) 
            = a measure of the statistical dependence b/w rankings of 2 variables
see formula for r_s 
            d_i = diff b/w the 2 rankings
            n = # of observations 
Spearman high --> similar rank, low --> dissimilar rank
Spearman postiive --> similar rank, negative --> dissimilar rank


OH:
- script takes a long time to run, but seems to work - fine? 
- script ad blocking
- turning in task2 program or just the csv?
- passing object type for methods in task 2 (i.e., easier to do a list or the query)
- rename files 
- need to submit extra txt file w/ results summary
